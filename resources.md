#Links to resources
A place to start researching. Research is key to developing a non bias, fair and educated opinion. This isn't part of the proposal but a place to share articles that may have an interesting perspective and could add value to the conversation.

KEY Catagories:
Research | Reference | Possibly Some Opinion | Opinionated | Bias | Discussion

Research: The systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions. But not referencing something's or someone's intent, opinions or motives.

Reference: Provide (a book or article) with citations of authorities.

Possibly Some Opinion: Almost entirely research but up to 3 minor points the author may have used working concidered by some to be opinionated. 

Opinionated: Conceitedly assertive and dogmatic in one's opinions or clearly marked as "opinion" by the publisher, i.e. op-eds and editorials in major newspapers.

Advocacy: Public support for or recommendation of a particular cause or policy. (Example NRA) 

Bias: Prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair.

Discussion: Conversation or debate in a forum of any media (forum threads, reddit threads, HN discussions, chat rooms, comment threads, etc.) 

Example Link Syntax: [ Title of Article ](http://linkToAwesomeArticle.com/information.html)(Research)

Note: This is erred on the side of caution. If someone (mostly anyone) could categorize this as opinion but mostly fact, it should be marked as opinion; like wise with opinion to bias. You are not going to convince someone to read a bias article by labeling it opinionated. That will only depreciate this resource.
