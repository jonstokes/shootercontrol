Q: What about guns that I inherited from my grandpa, or that I found on the street, or that belong to my wife, etc.? 

A: Under this system, nobody cares where or how you got a particular gun. We only care that you’re licensed to hold a gun. That’s it. If you’re licensed, you can pick up any gun legally. If you’re not licensed, touching a gun is a felony.

Q: How will this make potential victims of domestic violence safer?

A: Let’s say that Joe is a member of a small, family shooter network. Word gets around that he’s beating his wife, Lynette, and the other network members, fearing for their licenses, convene and vote him out.

At that point, Joe has just lost the ability to legally touch a firearm, even in the privacy of his own home. Lynette can remove his firearms from the house, and there’s no way he can legally bring them back. He can’t even legally stop her from carrying them out while he watches.

Now, if he’s crazy and violent, the threat of a felony charge isn’t going to stop him from grabbing a gun and shooting Lynette. But the current gun control regime wouldn’t be any help in this case, either. What the shooter network scheme has done, though, is to notify the central licensing authority that Joe has just been voted out of the network, and that authority can report this fact to local law enforcement. 

Joe’s loss of membership is a massive red flag that law enforcement did not have under the old regime, and it gives them an indication that something isn’t right and that they may want to further investigate and possibly intervene.

Again, shooter control doesn’t completely solve the problem of domestic gun violence, but it does add a powerful new tool — that of shared accountability and peer reporting — to the violence prevention toolbox.

Q: How will this stop lone wolf mass shootings and terror attacks?

A: It doesn’t necessarily prevent such things directly, but it gives the government and local law enforcement more opportunity to gather data. If you’re a member of a terrorist cell and you want to get access to firearms, you have two options: 1) find other terrorists to form a shooter network with you, or 2) go under the radar and join an existing shooter network of non-terrorists.

For option 1, if we’re actually keeping decent tabs on suspected terrorists, then the moment one of them joins a shooter network with other terrorists then bingo, we have the rest of the connections for a terrorist cell visible to the feds!.

For option 2, citizens have to understand that if you let someone into your shooter network and they turn out to be a terrorist, then you have a world of painful scrutiny coming your way…. it’s the last thing you’d ever want. So people are incentivized to do their very best ensure that this doesn’t happen at all costs.

Q: Can’t gangs easily abuse this system?

A: Initially, yeah they could, but as more gang members end up in jail that whole network starts to run out of people who can form a legit shooter network. Eventually, it’s going to be really hard for a gang member to find someone to join a shooter network with him or her.
